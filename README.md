Basic demonstration project showing use of RT-Thread Nano (https://github.com/RT-Thread/rtthread-nano) with a GD32VF103CB RISC-V MCU.

The demonstration is based on a GD32VF103C_START board, but is easily modified for other GD32VF103Cx boards (e.g. Sipeed Longan Nano).

There is a LED attached to PA7, which is set to blink, and a KEY attached to PA0. Pressing the KEY extends the LED on time.
